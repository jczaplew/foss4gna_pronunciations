# The Pronunciations of FOSS4G-NA 2013

While attending the FOSS4G-NA conference in Minneapolis, MN I realized the biggest problem plaguing the FOSS4G community was software (and their acronyms) pronunciation fragmentation. I attempted to keep track of the variations I heard, and (poorly) phonetically spelled them out into a little Meteor app.

* I am not a pronunciation expert, nor is this intended to be serious. I just needed an excuse to play around with Meteor.
